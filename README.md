# Password Generator Code

##  URL:

## Summary:

This a password genaertaor ranginging from 8 to 128 characters and has the ability to have numbers, uppercase, lowercase and special characters added to the code.

Mine does not use prompt windows. One of my TA's challenged me to use checkboxes and a slider, so I did, but that also ended up taking a little bit longer.

I started out with creating the checkboxes and slider. Then another connecting the slider and the number counter together, (which having them in the same div did not do lol). Then I attached my html ids with js variables. Then it was on to generating random characters, at first I tohught I would have to put them all in, but I then thought that there was no way someone didn't have a thing for this. Thats when I learned about the fromCharCode() attribute. After that , it just become a problem of testing them and putting them all together.

First was checking to see if my elements where checked and assigning them varaibles to then be put into the actual password.Then I created an array of objects to check if the character options where checked (to find if thats true), then created a for loop to loop over the length of the password and input characters in.

For this project I had to do alot of research because this was all completely new to me: my books, stackoverflow, youtube tutorials and just general googling and then trial and error
